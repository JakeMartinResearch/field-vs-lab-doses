# Aligning Behavioural Ecotoxicology with Real-World Water Concentrations: Current Minimum Tested Levels for Pharmaceuticals Far Exceed Environmental Reality

This repository contains all the scripts for the comparative analysis of pharmaceutical concentrations used in **laboratory-based exposure experiments** versus those detected in **natural field environments** in Martin et al (2025).

## 📖 Project Overview

Pharmaceutical pollution is an escalating issue, with widespread contamination now well-documented across aquatic ecosystems globally. In parallel, research into the behavioural effects of pharmaceuticals on aquatic organisms has expanded rapidly, revealing that some of these compounds can alter behaviour even at environmentally relevant concentrations. However, a recent systematic evidence map on this topic has highlighted substantial variability in the exposure concentrations used across behavioural tests---raising questions about their environmental realism. In this study, we compare 767 behavioural assays with over 10 million pharmaceutical occurrence records from three major global monitoring databases. Our analysis reveals that minimum tested concentrations in behavioural studies are, on average, 43 times higher than median surface water concentrations and 10 times higher than median concentrations in treated wastewater. Notably, more than half of the tested compounds were never assessed at levels below the 95% credible interval of observed wastewater concentrations. Furthermore, the pharmaceuticals most frequently tested in behavioural assays showed only weak correspondence with those most commonly detected in the environment. These findings suggest a significant misalignment between experimental design and environmental reality, potentially limiting the relevance of behavioural ecotoxicology for ecological risk assessments and evidence-based environmental regulation.
